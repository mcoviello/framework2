{#
    There several variables you can set at the top of a Twig to control some of the things
    that the Framework includes in the output. Look at twigs/content/page.twig to see all
    the possible variables and how they are used.
#}
{#
    If your page uses AJAX include this line at the start of the file - it loads a different version of jQuery.
{% set ajax = TRUE %}
#}
{#
    If your page uses the Framework JS util package include this line at the start of the file
{% set fwutils = TRUE %}
#}
{#
    If your page uses Parsley include this line at the start of the file
{% set parsley = TRUE %}
#}
{#
    If your page uses the inline editable package include this line at the start of the file
{% set editable = TRUE %}
#}

{#
    If your page does NOT need not use bootbox then this will stop the JS being loaded for it
{% set usebootbox = FALSE %}
#}


{% set title = context.user.login ~ '\'s Projects' %}


{#
   If you want a breadcrumb trail below the navbar set this
{% set breadcrumbs = [{link:'url1', text: 'Top Level'}, {link: 'url2': text: 'Second level'}, {text: 'Where we are'}] %}
#}

{#
   If you want a <meta> Keywords tag set this
{% set keywords = 'Framework, PHP, RedBean' %}
#}

{#
   If you want a <meta> Description tag set this
{% set description = 'A PHP framework for building RESTful systems' %}
#}

{#
   You can set a schema that describes the page with this variable - see http://schema.org for what values are available
{% set schema = 'itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/AboutPage"' %}
#}

{% extends '@content/page.twig' %}

{% block meta %}
{# <meta> for things like keywords etc.#}
{% endblock meta %}

{% block links %}
{# <link> for non-css and non-type things#}
{% endblock links %}

{% block type %}
{# <link> for webfonts #}
{% endblock type %}

{% block css %}
{# <link> for any other CSS files you need #}
{% endblock css %}

{# If you want some inline CSS then put it in this block - no <style> tags - it is better NOT to use this though!!
{% block style %}
{% endblock style %}

{# If you want to add critical CSS then put it in this block - no <style> tags
{% block criticalCSS %}
{% endblock criticalCSS %}

{# uncomment this if you don't want the default navbar to appear
{% block navigation %}
{% endblock navigation %}

{#
    Edit the file navbar.twig to change the appearance of the
    navigation bar. It is included by default from page.twig
#}

{# uncomment this and delete header block below to remove the <header> tag altogether
{% block pageheader %}
{% endblock pageheader %}
#}

{#
    If you have a standard header for all (most) pages then put the
    content in the file twigs/surround/header.twig. It is included by page.twig by
    default. You then don't need to have a header block either.
